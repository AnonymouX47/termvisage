<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-extras>`_:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is provided via the ``completions`` extra, as in:

.. code-block:: shell

   pipx install "termvisage[completions]"


Supported Terminal Emulators
----------------------------

Some terminals emulators that have been tested to meet the requirements for at least one render style include:

- **libvte**-based terminal emulators such as:

  - Gnome Terminal
  - Terminator
  - Tilix

- Kitty
- Konsole
- iTerm2
- WezTerm
- Alacritty
- Windows Terminal
- MinTTY (on Windows)
- Termux (on Android)

For render style-specific support, see :ref:`render-styles`.

.. note::
   Some terminal emulators support truecolor escape sequences but have a
   256-color palette. This will limit color reproduction.
